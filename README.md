This is a model of a donut shop.

A constructor function is used to capture the properties of the DonutShop object. Each instance of the object represents one store in the Top Pot chain of donut shops.

Using prototypes of the object, you can generate a random number of customers and how many donuts they will buy per hour based on a range of attributes supplied by the company (note: data is fictious for this assignment!).

The render() method populates a chart that models how many donuts are purchased each hour at all five locations, and provides the total number of donuts purchased that day in the last column.

To try out different data sets within the supplied ranges, refresh the page.

Thank you!
